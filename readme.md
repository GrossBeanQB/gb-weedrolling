Dear QBCore community,Here's another gift â€” a lightweight, plug-and-play rolling and smoking system fully integrated with the QBCore framework.

This script allows players to roll and smoke joints in a realistic, immersive way â€” complete with joint props, puffing animation, cancel behavior, and stress relief support. Itâ€™s been designed to be modular, optimized, and easy to customize.

How to Test

To try it out quickly on your server:

/giveitem  weed_og_kush_bud 1/giveitem  rolling_paper 1

Then open your inventory and use the rolling_paper to roll a joint.Once rolled, use the joint item to smoke it.

Features

Roll joints using any defined bud + rolling paper

Smoke joints to relieve 15 stress

Includes full animation, particle FX, and prop

You cannot roll or smoke if:

You're armed

You're eating or drinking (progressbar)

You're injured, dead, cuffed, ragdolled, or falling

You're already rolling or already smoking

Smoking cancels if:

You pull out a weapon

You press X (hands up)

You interrupt the animation

You do anything else that breaks focus

Joint is dropped on the ground when canceled
